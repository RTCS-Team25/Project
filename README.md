## Description

This project is a **mental health robot**, which draws on **the speech recognition capabilities** of Pepper alongside further research we undertook as to how interacting with robots can actually boost people‚Äôs mood. This project therefore is to create a spoken interaction between Pepper and a user. Pepper will be able to respond based on the user‚Äôs replies. If the user is not feeling happy, or gives sad answers to Pepper‚Äôs pre-set questions, then Pepper will be able to give advice and guide the user through some calming, meditative processes to boost the user‚Äôs mood.

## Aims

1. Allow Pepper to recognize a variety of phrases which the user may use in order to prompt an appropriate response.
2. Create a library of responses to allow Pepper to maintain a ‚Äòconversation‚Äô with the user.
3. (Advanced) Use both the speech function as well as the tablet screen to take the user through a guided meditation or provide a happy distraction in the form of pictures, symbols or animations.
